# EpicChain

**EpicChain** is an innovative project focusing on Optimized Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (O-DBFT) aimed at enhancing consensus mechanisms within the Neo ecosystem. Currently in its early stages, this project lays the groundwork for developing advanced optimization strategies tailored to improve the Neo Consensus framework.

## Project Overview

EpicChain is designed to explore and implement optimization strategies that enhance the efficiency and robustness of consensus protocols. Leveraging the flexibility of metaheuristics and mathematical programming models, EpicChain aims to address the complexities of trust and efficiency in decentralized systems.

### Key Features

- **Optimization Strategies**: Investigates and implements metaheuristics and mathematical programming models to improve consensus protocols.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Seeks to balance risk, quality, and communication speed between Neo ecosystem interfaces, aiming for an optimal Pareto Front.
- **Real-Time Decision Making**: Incorporates multi-criteria decision-making techniques to assist nodes in making informed decisions during blockchain operations.
- **High-Performance Computing**: Utilizes advanced computing techniques to enhance consensus speed and system robustness.
